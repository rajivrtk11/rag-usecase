The latest data \navailable refers to Q4 2017 and shows that said prices increased by 4.1% compared with the same \nquarter of 2016 (vide Charts II below).  \n \nWith regard to the number of permits, the Malta Environment and Planning Authority issued 7,508 \npermits during 2016, just over 90% more than in 2015 (statistics for 2017 have yet to be published). \nThis followed growth of 34.4% in 2014, marking three consecutive years of growth following a period \nof decline. The increase in permits issued in 2016 was mostly driven by the largest residential category, \nnamely apartments, which accounted for 84.1% of total permits granted.   \n55\n65\n75\n85\n95\n105\n115\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\nCHART II: Malta House Price Index\nSource: Eurostat\n"
